# War

A contrived example of a card game using Clojurescript, Reagent, and Reframe.

Play it here: <https://cstby.github.io/war/>



## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple yet completely playable game. This is my first original project, so comments and suggestions are more than welcome!

I used only the following dependencies:

- [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent)
- [Reframe](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
- [Figwheel Main](https://github.com/bhauman/figwheel-main) (for development)



## Features

- Complete ruleset for War, including ties and ending the game.
- All card movements are animated.
- Audio for card movements, winning, and losing.
- Modals for help, win, and lose.
- Scales to work on any device size in portrait or landscape.
